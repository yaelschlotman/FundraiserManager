When I looked up something on the Internet:

2/22:  Looked up again how to read/write to text. 
		Wrote up classes for file reader and file writer, 
		but I still don't understand it, really.

2/23:  Spent half an hour looking up and understanding "persistant data"
		after apparently irritating my instructor by simply asking 
		for clarification.  His response was "It means just what it says, 
		the data is persistant.  Nothing more to clarify."  Wow, if only I
		could read the written word, I would have understood that immediately.
		How stupid of me not to have innate understanding of a term I've never 
		seen before.  Or, perhaps, I simply needed clarification on an unfamiliar
		term I'd never seen before?   Good reminder not to bother asking an
		instructor for *instruction*.  

2/25:  Looked up how to convert string to int and decimal.
